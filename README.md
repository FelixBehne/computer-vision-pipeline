## About The Project

This project contains the machine learning pipeline for training a model used for image segmentation. Subsequently, this model can be deployed on the Nvidia Jetson computer purchased for this project and, in combination with the driving logic, forms the basis for the autonomous driving of the robot.

## Built With

* Kedro 

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-  [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) 
 ```bash
   # works on macos only
    brew install miniconda 
    
  # for window refer to the official documentation
 ```
- [Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
 ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge kedro
 ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

 ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dhbwmowro/computer-vision-pipeline
```

2. Install all requirements
 ```bash
    kedro install
 ```


## Roadmap
